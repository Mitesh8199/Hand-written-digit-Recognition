# Hand-written-digit-Recognition

This Project is capable of recognising any human hand written digits with the help of CNN and OpenCV.</br>
MNIST Digits Data is used in this project.</br>
First CNN  is used to train the model.</br>
Then the image is loaded in jpg format.</br>
With help of OpenCV contours are made around the digits in the image.</br>
This Image is then evaluated and predicted with the help of CNN.</br>

Please check the Jupyter Notebook for better understanding.
